# STAT403AnalysisAssignment


Given the dataset derived from the 2019 SSC case study here: https://ssc.ca/en/case-study/case-study-2-risk-cardiovascular-disease-among-osteoarthritis-patients

... predict cardiovascular disease (CCCA_121).

The data set you have is a random selection of 10,000 patients from the approximately 130,000 patients that were followed for 5 years. We are only looking at the first of three cycles.

1) Describe the response variable.
	Is it continuous / categorical / binary?
	What does its data type imply about the modeling method that is likely to work best?
2) Describe the other variables. 
	Which are continuous? Fixed effects? Random effects?
	Are there any variables that are NOT explanatory or a response? (e.g. IDs, weights)

3) Describe the missingness pattern.
	Are there any missing values? Which variables?
	Are the missing values randomly assigned, or are is there some observable pattern?
	What are you going to do about the missing data?

4) How are you going to decide which variables to use. Note that only the prediction accuracy matters (lowest deviance/AIC/BIC)?	

5) Describe your final model.
	How well does it fit the response?
	Are there any possible colliinearity / VIF issues?
	How much better/worse is the model when the arthritis variable CCCA_051 is in it?

Not every one of these questions needs to be answered distinctly. If you do something that effectively answers more than one question, explain that.
